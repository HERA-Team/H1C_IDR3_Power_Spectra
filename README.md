# H1C_IDR3_Power_Spectra

**EDIT August 1, 2023: I have made this repo public since [the paper is public](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04912). All the warnings about blinding and spoilers are now irrelevant.**

Repository for notebooks that compute H1C IDR 3.2 power spectra and supporting figures for papers and memos. 

**N.B. Do not look at the folder labeled SPOILERS unless you *know* that you do NOT need to keep yourself blinded.**

Furthermore, if you do unblind yourself, please add your name to [this list of people who are unblinded](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Y53_OuyETRFBRcAsM4DwAv9zK3tsC9GmT81W9iJS3E/edit#gid=0). Do not share plots or talk about the limits with people other than those listed in the "already unblinded" category. Do not share the contents of this repository outside the HERA collaboration.
